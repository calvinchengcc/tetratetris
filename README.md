# TetraTetris

An HTML5 game loosely based on Tetris, where blocks come from all four sides of the screen

#### Objective

The classic game of Tetris is quite one-dimensional; blocks only come from the top and keep falling downwards. Like many things in life, however, it's often nice to add a different perspective.

In this game, blocks will be spawned from all four sides of the screen, and your objective is to fill in rows from all four sides. A square will be cleared when all four sides have been filled at a certain height. The more squares you clear, the higher your score!

#### Controls

*   **Arrow keys** to move
*   **Z** to rotate tetromino clockwise
*   **X** to rotate tetromino counterclockwise
*   **Shift** to hold tetromino

#### Scoring

*   **10 points** for each block successfully placed
*   **100 Ã— 2<sup>x</sup> points** for clearing <var>x</var> squares at once
