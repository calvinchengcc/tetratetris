# TetraTetris

An HTML5 game loosely based on Tetris, where blocks come from all four sides of the screen

#### Objective

The classic game of Tetris is quite one-dimensional; blocks only come from the top and keep falling downwards. Like many things in life, however, it's often nice to add a different perspective.

In this game, blocks will be spawned* from all four sides of the screen, and your objective is to fill in rows from all four sides. A line will be "cleared" when all four sides have been filled. The more lines you clear, the higher your score!

<small>* The blocks don't naturally fall, as that would just make the controls too awkward.</small>

#### Controls

*   **Arrow keys** to move
*   **Z** to rotate tetromino clockwise
*   **X** to rotate tetromino counterclockwise
*   **Shift** to hold tetromino
